# JS Libs size comparison

The purpose of this repo is just to compare the size of different JS libraries. Fot each library, I created a simple TODO App with the exact same features.

## React

-> node_modules: 95M
-> download at runtime: 190Ko

## Vue

-> node_modules 62M
-> download at runtime 64.57 Ko

## Svelte

-> node_modules 58M
-> download at runtime 21.84Ko

## Angular

-> node_modules 363M
-> download at runtime 2.04Mo
